// Background services are limited in Android 8.0+.
// Use JobIntentService or WorkManager for longer-running tasks.

// If a component calls bindService() to create the service and onStartCommand() is not called,
// the service runs only as long as the component is bound to it.
// After the service is unbound from all of its clients, the system destroys it.

// The Android system stops a service only when memory is low and it must recover system resources
// for the activity that has user focus. If the service is bound to an activity that has
// user focus, it's less likely to be killed; if the service is declared to run in the
// foreground, it's rarely killed. If the service is started and is long-running,
// the system lowers its position in the list of background tasks over time,
// and the service becomes highly susceptible to killingâ€”if your service is started,
// you must design it to gracefully handle restarts by the system.
// If the system kills your service, it restarts it as soon as resources become available,
// but this also depends on the value that you return from onStartCommand().
